# CleaningCrewBot
bot for the cleaning crew discord

Uses the python 3.6 discord api

Current bot features:
-deletes messages that contain variations of "uwu" and "owo" and then instantly sends a message that says "[REDACTED]"
-deletes messages that contain :point_right: :point_left: emojis in that order and then instantly says "[REDACTED]"

Potential Ideas:

-Temporaily make it so the bot redacts all messages from console, and then remove this function after he finds out about it through use
