# CleaningCrewBot
bot for the cleaning crew discord

Uses the python 3.6 discord api

As of now it just deletes messages that contain variations of "uwu" and "owo" and then send a "[REDACTED]" message in chat immediately after.

Potential Ideas:

-Temporaily make it so the bot redacts all messages from console
