# CleaningCrewBot
bot for the cleaning crew discord

Uses the python 3.6 discord api

---------------------------------------------------------------

Current bot features:

-deletes messages that contain things like variations of "uwu" or "owo" and some emoji combinations and then instantly sends a message that says "[REDACTED]"

-give a few select people the ability to silence people with the bot, which makes the bot instantly redact all messages that person says regardless
  -the select few can also free that person from being silenced
   -only one person can be silenced at a time

---------------------------------------------------------------

Potential Ideas:

-Find a slur detecting library and use it with this bot
